# Weather App

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
First project with API. Build a weather app that shows weather for Stockholm, today and five days ahead.

## The problem

I had the most problems with the 5 day forecast and getting the pictures to work. How to access the inforation in an array. I didn't manage to get the icons so that I will try to do when I have time. As wells as look inte picture background.

## View it live

So this is where the netlify link goes üëç 

## Requirements (_from canvas) 
- You should fetch data from the API using `fetch()` in JavaScript ‚úî 
- All data in the sketch above should be present and fetched from the API ‚úî 
- The presentation of the data should be in the specified format. 
- The page should work on mobile (mobile first!), tablet and desktop (Be responsive). so and so... 
- Code follows Technigo‚Äôs code guidelines. ‚úî 

## 'Looking good' goals
